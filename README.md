This repository has files and instructions on how to create new Ulkolinja video feature project – including setting up the content system where content creators can edit the site without touching the source files. Assuming you have some understanding on basic Git operations and Fynd, the whole process shouldn't take more than an hour.  

Prerequisities

* Github account
* Node (v.8 or above)
 
## Steps to create new project and push it to Github 

1. Clone this repository  ```git clone git@github.com:antakasa/ulkolinja-videofeature.git```
2. Go to the folder ``` cd ulkolinja-videofeature```
3.  delete .git folder ``` rm -rf .gif```
4.  modify package.json.  Change *name* to something project specific, for example "2020-01-ulkolinja-kambodza"
5. modify src/helpers/AnalyticsMethods.js. Change *pageName* to something project specific (this is the keyword you need to find analytics data from Adobe). 
6. Initialize a new git project ```git init```
7. Make all files to be tracked by Git ```git add . ```
8. Create an initial commit ``` git commit -a -m "initial commit"```
9. Create new Github repository. This is mandatory. Go to https://github.com/new. Doesn't have to be public repo, private is fine. When created, copy the repo's ssh address to clipboard (you need it in the next step). 
10. Add the remote repo you created into your project ```git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourrepo.git``` 
11. Push the content into your repo ```git push -u origin master ```

### Create the content system - Netlify part

We use Netlify as a place where the content system lives. Follow these steps:

1. Log-in / register with your **Github account** in app.netlify.com. 
2. Create new "continous deployment" project (from Github) https://app.netlify.com/start
3. Choose the repo you created in the previous steps.
4. When the next view opens, scroll down to "build command". Insert ```npm run build:test``` here Also, insert ```build``` to "publish directory" field.  
5. press deploy site. 
6. go to "site settings".
7. Change general --> site details --> Site name to something project specific.
6. In site settings go to  --> Identity. Click "Enable identity".
7. In the site settings, go to Identity --> Services. Click "Enable Git Gateway".
8. Go back to your Netlify homesite by clicking the brand logo on the upper left corner. Select your project in the list.  On the top menu there are links such as "Overview, deploys, functions..." Click "Identity". 
9. Click "invite users" and write e-mail addresses of users you like to be able to log-in to content system. ** Netlify sends an confirmation link via e-mail. Make sure the users have clicked this link.**
10. Assuming the deployment has finished without errors, The CMS should be availalbe at [your-site-name].netlify.com/admin.

In case of error, see the deploy information in Netlify panel. Has the deploy failed? In that case, have a look at the log. If there is something wrong with the code, make changes in the code editor in your computer and run ```git commit -m "fix"``` ```git push -u origin master```. Netlify starts the deploy process automatically whenever something new has been committed into the repository. 

## Publishing to Yle

When all the content editing has been done, and you want to publish site to Yleisradio AWS S3 (assuming you have the correct access rights and tools):

1. go to repo and run ```git pull```
2. run ```npm run deploy```
3. Site should be available at lusi-dataviz.ylestatic.fi/[package-name]/index.html.
4. When embedding content into Fynd, in article settings select "External layout" and "Export as external content". The feature should work in Yle app too.
